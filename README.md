# DIGI-Interface
DIGI, PTT, CW interface, schematic, pcb, Eagle files

Project - Digi interface with 2 pots for input and output level of audio signal from PC.
Based on many different schematics, but adjusted to the needs of Radio club Zrenjanin YU7AOP.
This interface has proven to be good at working with different radio's (new and "old school":) such as:
FT901DM, FT101ZD, IC718, TS930S, FT950, FT897, some Codan's etc.

RS232 added as control port for CW and PTT. If not using CW or PTT line, simply set VOX on your RIG and use PTT via VOX on your radio.

Place interface into metal box to reduce RFI. I found on 2nd hand market defective 8 port LAN switch for about a 1$, perfect for this project.

PCB is toner-transfer method with hot Iron.
I have a lot of dual pots and PCB is adjusted for it. If you are friendly with Eagle you can change footprint for any other pot's.

Enjoy...
