# DIGI-Interface
DIGI, PTT, CW interface, schematic, pcb, Eagle files

Project - Digi interface with 2 pots for input and output level of audio signal from PC.

RS232 added as control port for CW and PTT. If not using CW or PTT line, simply set VOX on your RIG and use PTT via VOX on your radio.

Place board into metal box to reduce RFI. I found on 2nd hand market defective 8 port LAN switch for about a 1$, perfect for this project.

Enjoy...
